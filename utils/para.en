Killed in Action (CSH #4, Greenbelt House, Ralph RAPSON)
2009
Plaster, mesh, slate, zinc
58.27 x 67.72 x 5.12 inches
Pièce unique
All the project n°4 sketches, or 'Greenbelt house' (1945), stage a model family, in which it is usual for the father to come back home in his personal helicopter which would be the common vehicle in a naïf and optimistic perspective of the future.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA combines the helicopter blades with the three pavilions which compose the house. While the plaster is crumbling down, the blades metal appears to be the only everlasting element of the structure.

Killed in Action (CSH #6, Omega, Richard NEUTRA)
2009
Galvanized sheet metal, plastic, wood, aluminum, polyurethane
51.18 x 82.68 x 14.96 inches
Pièce unique
The Case Study House project n°6, or 'Omega' house (1945) should have been the neighbor of the CSH n°13, or 'Alpha' (cf. infra) and in harmony with it. It shows off an industrial sheet metal roof and exemplifies the typical Richard NEUTRA architectural features visible in the slight slope and in the large excesses. The low cost of the construction and the efficiency of the materials corresponded to the purchasers needs. Covered by white light reflecting gravel and made to prevent the penetration of warmth, this roof ensures a very good isolation to the whole construction. Finally the cruciform plan allows the inclusion of four courtyards, each having a specific function.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA uses the sheet metal roof principal and imagines the various it could have suffered, possible additions or perforations. He also evokes the four courtyards through a geometrical paving made of four polish polished steel plates, which are reminders of both Carl ANDRE' s theories and Frank STELLA's shapes.

48.82 x 422.05 x 11.02 inches
Pièce unique
The project n°21 (1947) bears the same number as a Pierre KOENING house which has been built. Richard NEUTRA's project has rarely has been included among the others. It is the least documented and the most mysterious, only mentioned by the architect in a brief text.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA considers this last work to be both the beginning and the end of his project, building lot and tabula rasa, here a black metal sheet - obtained through an industrial process consisting in an oil dip – characterized by a strong aesthetic charge, partly enclosed by a fence borrowed to the SNCF. This fence was used to close an abandoned track where from came the metal sheets made in the factory where the artist found the one used in the masterpiece, thus coming full circle.

2009
Tiles, steel, reinforced glass, rubber
55.91 x 28.74 x 10.63 inches
Pièce unique
The project n°24 (1961) contributed to a profoundly innovative approach, not only, to the idea of community planning but also to the design of individual houses. Envisioned as a unit of 260 houses on land near Northridge, the master plan provided space for a park and a recreation center for the community made of the sharing of the individual building lots. To optimize the sound proofing and cater the need for privacy, the houses where protected by a seven-feet retaining wall and the floors were lowered approximately two feet below the conventional level. Constructed on a sloping ground, each house was topped by a monumental flat roof consisting in a perforated metal structure, and including an air-conditioning system.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA, to whom this architectural radicalism reminds the social constructions' one, imagines a base made of industrial tiles, like the ones often used to plate building fronts when aesthetics considerations give way to durability needs. A steel and reinforced glass roof rises from this base, a totem streaked with a warm rust color. The metal corrosion creates an intensive contrast with the tiles durability which, in spite of his frail aspect, is much more resistant to the passing of time.

Killed in Action (CSH #5, Whitney R. SMITH)
2009
Wrapping, steel, cement, idle asbestos, lace, ceramic
54.33 x 50.39 x 13.78 inches
Pièce unique
The Case Study House project #5 (1945) was implementing the idea of an open house, walls mainly made out of glass abolishing the limits between the inside and the outside of its four pavilions.
Noting the utopian aspect of this principle, which in a suburban environment almost certainly ends up with a thuja hedge, Wilfrid ALMENDRA offers a cement barrier as the border between the interior and the exterior. The pavilions themselves become varnished wainscot compartments, a typical material of the 'Do it yourself' approach which characterizes the interior decoration of the 1970s and 80s. Through the transformation of the architecture into interior decoration, a tendency emphasized by the presence of a vase typical of the wainscoting era, the artist reminds us of the fact that often furniture was included in the ‘complete' programs of the Case Study Houses.

The Case Study House project n°13, or 'Alpha' house (1946), should have been the neighbor of the CSH n°6, or 'Omega' (cf. infra) and in harmony with it. The project consisted in an elegant wood boarded residence, remarkable for its impressive interior / exterior fireplace and for the large shot-through terrace.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA uses anew those elements, but imagines the becoming of the house, widely covered by a thick plaster which is typical of the pavilions aesthetic and characteristic of the artist's autobiographical signature.

Wilfrid ALMENDRA cut with a lapidary an impressive asphalt piece from a road, which turned over becomes the lunar ground on which a thick sheet metal, cut by laser, is fixed via thins columns – in short the combination of two radical cuts, the crafty and the industrial one.

Wood, cement, rubber, steel
39.37 x 40.94 x 21.26 inches
Pièce unique
The project n°27 (1963) is the only one that has been conceived on the East coast of United States, it could have been the first one to leave the city and its suburbs for the country and a wooded environment and a pond – becoming an anticipation of the coming change of rural areas. The house was a prototype for mass production of residence made with prefabricated concrete. It consisted in a group of five units, the goal being to allow each unit a direct relationship to the natural surroundings. Topped by pyramidal roofs, the prefabricated concrete modules, required no interior walls or columns, and their shapes contrasted with that of the flat-roofed passageways serving as connectors between them.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA does a composition piece in which the origin of each material has a specific sense: the chestnut door of his family house in Portugal, more than 150 years old, becomes the platform; the pyramidal covering of the cement pillars wall, taken from a working class housing development, -and replaced by identical ceramic ones-, becomes the five blocks roofs, and a rubber treadmill strip taken from a Michelin factory becomes the connection corridors between the modules. All at once the artist evokes the history of his family, the memory of the workers and the memory of the residential area bred from a scolding and familiar capitalism.

Steel, iron bars, teflon, cement
59.06 x 42.13 x 7.48 inches
Pièce unique
The project n°12 (1946) mixes flat roofs, cement structures and wood boards.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA combines these three elements in one reinforced concrete sculpture, in which the wood grain framework is visible, and completed by a monumental staircase made of concentric teflon arc of circles. The outstanding iron bars principally recalls the ones which often appear under the decrepit cement and the unfinished houses – iron skeletons and familiar outlines typical of Southern European landscapes.

42.52 x 40.16 x 8.66 inches
Pièce unique
The CSH project #19 (1957) 'proceeds from the idea of a controlled environment in contrast with the surrounding nature; (...) the manmade environment will be here defined by a platform elevated 6" above grade' ('Arts and Architecture'). The design of the project downplayed convenience in favor of formal concerns in both the setting of the house and its relation to its environment. Just like sculptures on a pedestal, various geometrical objects were to be placed on the square platform: an H-shaped house and a garage, both with a flat roof, and a swimming pool, inconveniently set apart from the house – it's in California in the 1950s that pools started to develop in private residences, before proliferating worldwide as an emblematic part of a certain lifestyle standard.
Wilfrid ALMENDRA creates a platform of the same height as the one originally planned; therefore disproportionate compared to the other elements, its scale evokes the 'above the street' urban planning very common in France in the 1960s. The pedestal is covered with deactivated concrete paving slabs, a product first used in collective housing before spreading to the terraces of private houses in the 1970s. The house and the garage are rendered through surfaces of plasterboard on metal rails – an industrialized building technique imported to France after WWII –, here coming from the renovation site of a 15th century castle, whereas the blue shape of the pool stands out from the composition.
Through materials and shapes, Wilfrid ALMENDRA plays a constant back and forth between the individual and the collective.

Vanessa BEECROFT
VB51
Opening and film premiere Saturday, April 5, 2003, from 6 pm to 9 pm
On view from April 8 to May 24, 2003, Wednesday to Saturday, 2 pm to 7 pm
For her solo exhibition at COSMIC GALERIE, Vanessa BEECROFT presents VB51, a 60 minutes documentary of the performance which took place on August 31, 2002 at Count Peter Metternich's castle of Vinsebeck, in Germany.
In the performances that have established her international reputation, Vanessa BEECROFT sets a group of characters, usually an homogenous selection of nude or undressed young women, in a tableau vivant. All the components are meticulously chosen according to autobiographical concerns, and sometimes contextual considerations. For the artist, 'the girls' are at the same time the basic material of her work as well as projections of herself. During the performance, lasting for several hours, they stay silent, immobile and impassive to the audience, occasionally breaking their initial order to sit or stretch. In this way the painting comes to a life of its own. The piece is documented by photographs and sometimes a video.
VB51 is a milestone in Vanessa BEECROFT's work: the film that is drawn from this performance is meant as an autonomous piece. The artist was inspired by the setting (not an art space, but a private home, the summer residence of a German high aristocracy family) and by the movie Last Year in Marienbad by Alain RESNAIS, whose suspended and refined atmosphere she manages to evoke. The protagonists are twenty five women of various ages and features: members of the artist's family (mother, sister and mother-in-law), representatives of the local aristocracy and two aristocrats ad honorem, the German actresses Irm HERMANN and Hanna SCHYGULLA.
They all represent the same woman at different psychological moments and ages of her life. The white Sant'Angelo gowns that most of the women wear participate in making them timeless and reinforce the general feeling of evanescence. Hanna SCHYGULLA, muse of director Rainer Werner FASSBINDER, among others, breaks the rule of silence for the first time in a performance, as she intones lyrics from Franz SCHUBERT's Winterreise. The audience, that the artist wanted formally dressed, contributes to the overall vision and is therefore part of the film.
Through these multiple aspects of one woman, Vanessa BEECROFT places herself both outside the action, being its invisible organizer, and at the centre of it, identifying herself, at this particular moment of her life, with all these women in general but with no one in particular.
Also shown at COSMIC GALERIE are group photographs and two series of portraits from VB51.

Artistes :: Annika Larsson :: Presentation
Annika LARSSON's video installations represent slightly altered universes obeying autonomous rules. The artist stages only men and deals with primarily male themes and their symbolic language, questioning expressions of power, submission and violence.
Annika LARSSON created the video Pink Ball which deals with recurrent themes in her work. In the middle of a meticulously controlled setting (a smooth and sterile beach), three impassive men seem to be absorbed by minimal, ritualized and enigmatic actions. Two of the protagonists play with the third one, whose pink bathing cap echoes the pink ball of the Sony Aibo dog seen at the beginning of the video. This type of robot is indeed programmed to be attracted by the color pink.
The sharp precision of the framing reinforces the singularity of the icy settings and the use of sound – an electro cover of The Cure's track The Forest by artist Tobias BERNSTRUP – as an autonomous element emphasizes the inner tension of the video. The ambiguity of attitudes and relations of strength between the different characters lies in the fact that the only expression of power is established by the real “queen of the game”, Annika LARSSON. "The people I use in my works, rather then creating characters, become figures lacking individual history or depth; they are mere ciphers. I do not mean to just represent Everyman, rather each one of them is the carrier of a wider dialogue strictly related to myself and my intimate being".
Rather than developing an analytical discourse or a simple narrative, she submerges us into a peculiar world where perfection, elegance and the power of details - a hand on a rose bath cap, a pink ball in a man's mouth – confront us with our distress facing the power which emerges from her images.

The Unity of the Real

The Unity of the Real (Installation view)
2003
Pièce unique
The Unity of the Real is also the title of the canvas completing the installation. Divided in four parts, each designed in a different technique and representing a cat, it is a perfect metaphor for the suggested mental construction in which each fragment is united with the others by one communal denominator: reality itself. Mixing styles and media the artist's interest lies first and foremost in the confrontation between twisted, oversized or distorted objects and the viewer's subjectivity. The installation ‘The Unity of the Real' is literally the manifesto of this preoccupation through its production. In the tradition of Gino DE DOMINICIS' living sculptures, an elderly person in a wheelchair is flanked by two inanimate sculptures for which the figure functions as the link. In the distorted prism of the silent protagonist's spirit, a German helmet appears - monumental and rusty at the same time – reflecting the weight of the historical period it recalls.

The entire façade of a house of Amsterdam exposed at Cosmic Galerie, staggering the conventional in painting and in architecture. Its title "It takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back" is a reference to the mythical album of the rap group "Public Enemy" and expresses the idea that an artist doesn't shrink from almost anything.

Bugada & Cargnel :: Exhibitions :: Marc BIJL - Afterhours :: Press release
Marc BIJL
Afterhours
Opening on Friday January 13, 2006, from 6 pm to 9 pm
Exhibition on view from January 14 until March 3, 2006
Wednesday to Saturday, 2 pm to 7 pm
The logos, symbols and other representations of post-capitalist aesthetics are the centre of Dutch artist Marc BIJL's work. Using the medium best appropriate to each situation – installations, sculptures, videos, (often illegal) public interventions, posters, stickers etc. – he formulates his own iconoclastic and subversive aesthetics, influenced by punk and gothic subcultures.
Marc BIJL questions symbols of power – either political, religious or commercial – as well as those of protest movements, to demonstrate their archetypes and stakes, playing off of each other. Through a re-contextualisation of these simplified signs of complex power structures, he underlines their paradoxes, not hesitating in the same time to deconstruct his own language of subversion.
For his first show in Paris, Marc BIJL presents Afterhours, a monumental installation of a restyled basketball field. Surrounded with fences and barbed wire, haloed with fog, the work reminds of a street basket field in a no-go area or in a prison. But, with his lines made of fluorescent tubes and its unreal atmosphere, the installation evokes as well the set of a stylized video clip or a commercial for a sport brand, which turns the sport field into an arena where modern day gladiators confront each other.
Through the dramatic setting and aggressive imagery developed by these brands, here recreated by Marc BILL, the basket field hence becomes, beyond its original function, a symbol, a logo. After the brands (for instance Nike's 'Swoosh'), the individuals (like Che GUEVARA, whose sense of action got romanticized while his face was flowered on T-shirts) and the events (such as the attack against the World Trade Centre), public space itself has been turned into a symbol, through a 'logo-isation' process.
Far from any judgment, Marc BIJL simply reformulates and extends the statement already pointed out by Herman HESSE in his book Steppenwolf (1927), a quote of which is spray painted on a wall in the exhibition space, already warning the world against simple mindedness and inspiring a dark romanticism as a reaction to this phenomenon. Marc BIJL increases the confusion, voluntarily creating an installation which adds to the power of seduction of the system he casts a light on.
Marc BIJL also shows a video piece shot in deserted streets in New York, whose atmosphere evokes the one of the installation.
Marc BIJL was born in Leerdam (Pays-Bas), 1970. He lives and works in Rotterdam.

Continuing his work on the standardized architecture of suburban houses, Wilfrid ALMENDRA presents a new series entitled "Model Home (Sonata)", in reference to this type of music in several movements. The diversion of various materials salvaged from construction sites of individual houses such as Phoenix, emblem of suburbia in the 80s, leads to forms instantly recognizable but unrelated to their original function. The yellow glass tiles of the entrance, the safety glass of the basements as well as the opaque tiles of the bathrooms of these houses are mounted on an entry railing or an anti-burglar bar to give a new form of ideal.
The sculpture similar to a stained-glass window brings a new dimension both ornamental and sacred, giving to these scrap materials a new value, between fragility and nostalgia for bygone days.

Wilfrid Almendra
Grand Opus
2009
Slate, iron, concrete, earth, “Americana” agave
51.18 x 92.52 x 105.51 inches
Pièce unique
In Grand Opus, Wilfrid ALMENDRA questions the suburban destiny of modernist utopia. He draws his inspiration from the work of French dandy architect Roger LE FLANCHEC, a follower of Le Corbusier active in Brittany during the 60's and 70's, who aimed at combining modernism with regionalism, particularly through the use of vernacular materials. Grand Opus recalls the facade of a villa by LE FLANCHEC, covered with slabs of stone, some of which drawing discrete minimal perspectives. ALMENDRA translates it into a slope made of slabs of slate, simultaneously harmonious and testing the limits of balance; the slope is perforated by an agave, as a symbol of chic exoticism frequently found in the patios of modern bourgeois villas.

I am printing out the star maps and drawing the stars by hand onto acetate and printing them, photographically. The sky becomes black because the paper is exposed to light but the stars are white because I have drawn in black in those places. I am making all 100 (and showing a different selection for each exhibition.
They should be installed on the wall according to the geographical location of the original pictures. For each installation, I will make a key drawing with the captions for each image, positioned in the corresponding geographical position".

Influenced by nomadism, Ian TWEEDY exploits all types of materials (maps, book covers, ancient documents, etc)as a means of expression, seizing elements from the recent past and his own history. In A Message from the Restless the artist uses the back of an old movie poster to reproduce in drawing found pictures forming an extremely cinematographic sequence having lost its meaning and open to interpretation.

GAILLARD's archeological approach toward nature and architecture can be noted in his 'Geographical Analogies'. In these wooden boxes, he has carefully arranged nine polaroids taken in various locations. The juxtapositions draw analogies, for instance, between natural sites in Mexico and housing projects in the Bronx, be it for their visual correspondences or their geological placement, highlighting in each photo the same sense of fragility.
The Geographical Analogies, however, stand several levels apart from documentary photography, turning the photographical evidence of disrepair into an intuitive course through evocative elements, a narrative weft stretched across these real locations.
Displayed like butterflies under glass, the Analogies' crystalline formation belies an intricate, if expansive, taxonomy of concerns, from geopolitics to youth culture, geology to art history.

Bugada & Cargnel :: Exhibitions :: Sarah EMERSON - Vidya GASTALDON - Maria MARSHALL :: Press release
Sarah EMERSON
Vidya GASTALDON
Maria MARSHALL
Exhibition on view from April 6 until 22 May, 2004
Tuesday to Saturday, 2 pm - 7pm
For her first exhibition in France, Sarah EMERSON has created a series of painting featuring wild animals – wolves, deers, a fox, a snake –in their natural habitat. In a climate of sometimes autumnal, sometimes wintry tones, scenes of violence – scenes of wolves hunting, or fighting over a piece of meat – alternate with moments of calm, where omnipresent death continues to prowl.
Her painting technique and use of colour evoke the American Pop art tradition and seem in opposition to the natural subjects represented. The kaleidoscopic effect of the applications of contrasting colours makes the figurative scenes lean towards abstraction. Tightly focused, these scenes melt into their background. The animal world appears here in all its ferocity as in all its vulnerability, intimately linked to its environment. Revealing a cruel and majestic nature, the works of Sarah EMERSON come to establish a sentiment both disturbing and dreamy.
Sarah EMERSON was born a Port Huron (USA). She lives and works in New York. She has exhibited widely including at White Columns (New York), Creative Alliance (Baltimore) and London House (London).
In her first exhibition in France, Vidya GASTALDON presents the installation Paysage – Rhizome – Œufs (Landscape – Rhizome – Eggs) consisting of thirty 'eggs', different sized wire structures, rhizome like, covered with knitted and sewn wool with different colours. Inspired by microbiology, the structure of each 'egg' consists of a network of links creating a form that is both geometric and organic, evoking the architecture of Buckminster FULLER. These entities evolve between the animal and the vegetable, or more so they express the dream of a hybridisation of these two kingdoms, reaching for the fullness of the kingdom of life. These abstract beings lie on the floor to form 'families', according to affinities recognised by the artist. In this way the works constitute a landscape that is both psychic – a concentration of mental images, and sensual – linked to the visual and tactile qualities of the forms and materials.
Being both a return towards the interior and a projection beyond the self, this strange and poetic universe is marked by the nostalgia for ecological and social utopias of the 1970s. This nostalgia can also be found in the series of drawings lying somewhere between Primitivism and Futurism that are also part of the exhibition, or in the video Bright Vader, an enlightened and mythical animated version of the evil Darth Vader from Star Wars.
Vidya GASTALDON was born in 1974 in Besançon. She lives and works in Geneva and has exhibited widely, including at the Centre Culturel Suisse (Paris), the Centre d'art contemporain (Geneva), Centre National de la Photographie (Paris) and the CAPC (Bordeaux).
Maria MARSHALL works on a body of large-scale video projections, renewing links with the psychological dimensions of cinema. The artist plunges us into a world of childhood, this being a pretext to evoke the anxieties of adults, also onto to her own anxieties at being a mother. Maria MARSHALL makes her own children the protagonists of these works, as charming putti bearing all the attributes of innocence. Nevertheless the children are depicted in scenes of danger, in an anguishing context or confronted with adult responsibilities. Anxiety, even discomfort develops when the viewer is faced with the impossibility of intervening on behalf of these children whose physical or psychic integrity is threatened.
The images are strongly aestheticised with a most particular attention to light and the rendering of colour, and the way of suggesting danger in an extremely seductive way. The power of these works resides in the fragile balance between fascination linked with the visual seduction of the images and the unease provoked by a feeling of underlying violence. Maria MARSHALL's mastering of cinematographic techniques, the great rigour of her direction and the repetitive aspect of projections give these brief narratives a truely hypnotic dimension.
In this show Maria MARSHALL presents three works: in Cyclops (2002, diptych 35 mm film, colour and surround sound) a screen shows a child standing in a room, filmed in an oscillatory manner by a Cyclops digital camera. The camera plays the role of interrogator and its movements are programmed to correspond to the idea associated with words such as 'love', 'hate', 'tenderness' or 'boredom'. On the second screen programed lighting effects – strobe, spotlight, red light etc – lighten the body of the artist and interrogate her about the same concepts. The sound of the movie, a powerful blast, is the actual one of the camera.
Multiplying references to the history of art – notably in the film's carefully accessorised composition, reminding Jacopo POTORMO's Pietà –, Pinocchio (2003, film 35 mm, colour and sound) evokes the hard position of a woman between desire for maternity and the will for emancipation. Maria MARSHALL, seated facing the camera in a caravan, speaks, with much maternal love and daily life details, about the baby she holds on her knees, who is in fact a doll. In a single sequence during which the candles burn out in reverse, Maria MARSHALL repeats three times her monologue on the role and the responsibility of a woman and a mother, and of the difficult conciliation of the two roles. The third time, one of the doll's legs starts moving.
10,000 Frames (2004, Super 8 film transferred to mini DV, colour and sound) is the artist's filmed journal of her trip to Disney World, Florida in the company of her two children; 6 days, 12 hours of filming each day, hence 10,000 images projected at an accelerated speed in 6 minutes and 40 seconds, becomes like a comical and hallucinatory trip to the land of Mickey.
Finally, Maria MARSHALL presents a perfume edition Sean (2002-2004, limited edition of 50, each signed and numbered by the artist), developed in collaboration with the Quest International Laboratories and presented in a bottle and packaging specially designed by the artist. Created as an extension to the film Playground – projected in in 2002 at the Palais de Tokyo (Paris) with the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations –, the green and woody notes of the perfume evoke the adolescent in the film. Maria MARSHALL will also be presenting four photographic works from Playground.
Maria MARSHALL was born in Bombay in 1966. She lives and works in London. She has exhibited at Palais de Tokyo (Paris), the Herzliya Museum (Israel), the Printemps de Cahors (France), the Goteborgs Konsthall (Sweden) and the Freiburger Kunstverein (Swisserland).

Ever Prosperity
Wilfrid ALMENDRA, Pierre BISMUTH, Nick DEVEREUX, Gardar EIDE EINARSSON, Lisa OPPENHEIM

Ever Prosperity was a Liberty ship cargo vessel, based in Monrovia, Liberia. In 1965, she was wrecked on the West Coast barrier reef of New Caledonia. In 1970, her sister ship, who belonged to the same ship-owner, had been given the same name and the same Korean captain, met with the same destiny, just a few miles away from the first wreck. Braving the curse which ironically seems to weigh on this name yet so full of promises, the exhibition Ever Prosperity brings together works by five artists who apply here their artistic approach on pre-existent cultural material.
Thus, Wilfrid ALMENDRA confronts the Utopian forms of New Babylon, Dutch artist Constant NIEUWENHUYS' ideal urban project, with those of suburban neighbourhoods and industrial areas.
First through a pair of almost twin sculptures While Waiting for a Revolution (2010), each consisting of a triangular plinth – triangles being a recurrent form for Constant, linked to nomadism –, topped by a shape with a curving rim. One of the pedestals is made of boards recycled from palettes, bearing the stigma of an industrial process, the sanding of metallic parts: veins of wood are ploughed, and residues of paint have printed its surface; the other plinth, made of concrete, has been casted with the same boards, leaving their marks in negative. The shape on each pedestal takes that of a very sculptural water tower, who caught the artist's eye very early on; being the only construction in a provincial town to challenge the usual architectural typologies, it recalls observatories planned by Constant; the sculpture on the concrete plinth is covered with a veneering, recalling the outside of a formwork, whereas the other, on the wooden pedestal, is made of cast concrete. Wilfrid ALMENDRA therefore plays on the notion of positive / negative, and the notion of series, central in Constant's work.
The artist also worked on two blow up prints of photographs of small scale models of Constant's utopic city, anticipating their suburban destiny with heavy plaster and veneering (Second Skin, 2010).
Pierre BISMUTH, meanwhile, performs the impossible synthesis between the two faces of Le Corbusier: from the villas blanches to housing projects, with a sense of humor and economy of means that are his trademark. He superposes, in a small scale model, section views and computer generated images (Complexes des villas / Bâtiment Le Corbusier, 2006-2010), several Villas Savoye, to create a building that the Swiss architect might not have rejected – let alone the destiny of neglected social housing and the carcass of torched cars in front.
Gardar EIDE EINARSSON applies his black and white grid to a colorful painting by Roy LICHTENSTEIN, changing the register of that sea view, from Pop art to Abstract post-war (Seascape, 2010).
Nick DEVEREUX, as for him, orchestrates subtle back and forth: between movement and immobility, from Jackson POLLOCK painting to Hans NAMUTH's photos of him in his atelier; also over time, between CARAVAGGIO's paintings and the movie Derek JAREMAN directed on the Italian artist.
In his drawings as in his paintings, DEVEREUX works with an old technique, used for example by Diego VÉLASQUEZ in Las Meninas, which doesn't aim at creating a 'photo realist' image but focuses on information perceived by the human eye, ie essentially volumes and light, hence offering an original answer to the conceptual question of representation. DEVEREUX applies this technique not to human beings or objects, but to small sculptures he makes from scraps of fabric and pieces of glass; non-figurative, these sculptures, when reproduced with this distinctive technique, get animated with unsuspected life.
In the 'Pollock series', DEVEREUX draws on pages of the first French edition of Hans NAMUTH's book of pictures of Jackson POLLOCK painting in his studio, that were a crucial contribution to Action Painting's legend, propagating a sense of expressivity more efficiently the paintings themselves. Drawing from a unique scultpure, DEVEREUX erases images of POLLOCK and renders his moves as a complex, dynamic yet abstract web of lines. Between POLLOCK's Action Painting, NAMUTH's photographic caption of it and DEVEREUX's rendering of these images through one of his distinctive sculptures and drawing technique, appears a fascinating back and forth between movement and stillness.
In Version (DG 1986) (2010), Nick DEVEREUX applies a similar process to an image taken from the movie Caravaggio by Derek JARMAN, on the life of the Baroque painter, where several perfectly detailed tableaux vivants restage yet to be painted works of the master. On a print of Saint Jerome, which is itself a reproduction, DEVEREUX reproduces in painting a small scale model he created, inspired by movements building the original painting.
Lastly, in Art for the Public: Images from the Collection of the Port Authority (2009), Lisa OPPENHEIM revives the memory of works from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's collection of public art, stored in the basement of the World Trade Center and destroyed during 9/11. They now only exist in a 1986 catalogue, which gave it's title to the series, a gathering of fantomatic works. Meditating on this 'presence absence', Lisa OPPENHEIM rephotographed in silver emulsion all images and printed a positive and a negative of each, that she then superposed; but when positive on negative should cancel one another out, through slight misregistrations, a ghostly trace remains.

Occupancy by More Than 6'682'685'387 Persons is Dangerous and Unlawful - Part One
An exhibition by Pierre BISMUTH
In collaboration with Cory ARCANGEL, Stefan BRÜGGEMANN, Gardar Eine EINARSSON, Matias FALDBAKKEN, Cyprien GAILLARD, Claire FONTAINE, Elisaveta KONSOLOVA, Thomas LÉLU, Jonathan MONK, Aaron SCHUSTER
Exhibition on view from September 17 until November 21st, 2008
Wednesday to Saturday, 2 pm - 7 pm
Under an ironically Malthusian title paraphrasing occupancy signs in public places in the US, Pierre BISMUTH has invited ten artists and writers to each collaborate on an artwork around a theme that is central in his practice, the notion of 'sabotage'.
Familiar with collaborations, in the visual arts field and beyond (amongst other things, he wrote the synopsis of the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which made him the only visual artist to ever win an Academy Award, for Best Original Screenplay in 2005, along with director Michel GONDRY and scenarist Charlie KAUFMAN), Pierre BISMUTH seizes the opportunity to blur the classical notion of authorship.
Turning away from the solitary monologue of the artist and exploring various ways of collaborating, the exhibition is both a repeated challenge of creation with four hands and two brains, and the prototype of an original curatorial experience.
In Shallow, Bismuth's work on the drifting of meaning in language, as expressed in his Synonym series, crosses Stefan BRÜGGEMANN's conceptual nihilism. The word 'SHALLOW' is superimposed over neon tubing which reads 'NO CONTENT'. The synonyms, however, are opposed by their formal presentation, the pristine neon piece being ‘vandalized' by a vulgar graffiti letters.
In their second piece, Two Letters, an 'N' and an 'O' in neon tubing, filled only by the artists' breath, have been arranged in such a way that they may be read as either 'NO' or 'ON'.
Gardar EIDE EINARSSON often makes use of visual imagery borrowed from underground subcultures including the criminal world and left-wing militias. Using a primarily black-and-white palette, the work has stylish punk sheen that evokes rebellion through its cold, hard-edged rejection of sentiment. For their collaboration Antisocial, EIDE EINARSSON's produced a diptych of two identical paintings of geometrical figures based on criminal tattoos; one of them was then perforated by Bismuth, in a gesture very typical of him; the holes cut through the figures reveal the canvas' underlying wooden support.
One Spray Can Not For Public Use, with Matias FALDBAKKEN, is a self-defeating piece of writing, where the act of inscription entails its own effacement. A text is written with a spray paint can, with the proviso that the can be used until it is empty, thus obliterating the original phrase in an illegible blob of pigment. Bismuth chose the phrase 'Not For Public Use' as an ironic comment on Faldbakken's form, which is both eminently public (visible) and indecipherable (obscured).
BISMUTH and Claire FONTAINE's joint venture Exhibitions consists of a series of videos in which curators mime an artwork of their choice. The aim of the project is to render a certain form of protagonist presence to the body of the curator. By using the physical potential of communication to describe a plastic form, language becomes secondary and another type of wordless comprehension is instituted and shared with the spectator.
For his collaboration between BISMUTH and Cyprien GAILLARD, the latter established the rule of the game, by giving BISMUTH a series of works in which he should intervene. The works are four old black and white postcards that have been, in a manner typical of GAILLARD's corrective approach of landscape, partially obscured by ripped pieces of white paper, which gives them a conceptual link with BISMUTH's Collages for Men. In an openly provocative manner, BISMUTH has signed his name on the white spaces — a game of appropriation and a play on the function of proper names equally emblematic of Bismuth's practice.
Applying to Elisaveta KONSOLOVA's monochrome series of Corrective Paintings one of BISMUTH's concepts, their Potemkin Landscape refers to the story of Potemkin Villages, fake settlements supposedly erected at the direction of Russian minister Grigori Aleksandrovich POTEMKIN to fool Empress Catherine II during her visit to Crimea in 1787. According to this story, POTEMKIN, who led the Crimean military campaign, had hollow facades of villages constructed along the desolate banks of the Dnieper River in order to impress the monarch and her travel party with the value of her new conquests, thus enhancing his standing in the empress's eyes. KONSOLOVA and BISMUTH's work ironically reverses the principle of the Potemkin Village for the era of late capitalism. The 'corrective painting' is meant as a screen to hide the eyesores of capitalist development and return the frenzy of unsightly building projects and garish touristic spectacles back to the serenity of nature.
BISMUTH's collaboration with Thomas LÉLU (Untitled) is a work composed of the superimposition of two images of well-known artworks. This chaotic 'doubled' vision of art mirrors the disorientation of spectators in an accelerated world where there is no longer any stable criteria of evaluation. At the same time, the crossing of two familiar iconographies sabotages their intended effects and produces accidental, unexpected resonances.
Jonathan MONK and BISMUTH, who have collaborated on several occasions, produced a play of mirror reflections: a pair of mutually referring paintings, almost identical, reading 'This painting should ideally be hung to the right of a Pierre BISMUTH' and 'This painting should ideally be hung to the left of a Jonathan MONK'. Having been painted by a third person, the literal instructions of the works are short-circuited, neither painting being attached to the artist via a physical act. What remains is a logical paradox, in which artistic activity is transformed — along the lines of the conceptual tradition from DUCHAMP to KOSUTH – into a game of pointing.
The rule of this meta-artistic work is that it is always linked to another artwork, thus subverting the ideal of artistic autonomy: dependency is made a necessity.
MONK and BISMUTH's other work together, Object Used to Fill in the Space, makes use of any leftover material to make a piece according to the needs of the exhibition: an artistic stopgap to ensure that there are no empty spots in the show.
Famous, BISMUTH's collaboration with writer and philosopher Aaron SCHUSTER, starts from Andy WARHOL's notorious phrase, 'In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes'. Already in WARHOL's time the line was an instant cliché, too true to be true, and so the artist subjected it to a number of permutations: 'In the future fifteen people will be famous' or 'In fifteen minutes everybody will be famous.' SCHUSTER has created a new variation, transforming the phrase into a tautology about time and a comment on the accelerated pace of contemporary history: 'In fifteen minutes everyone will be in the future.' BISMUTH's animated setting gives the static statement a sense of duration implied in the title, and provides a minimal video version of WARHOL's aesthetic. The video's shifting color scheme translates WARHOL's spatial seriality put back into the medium of time – the time spent watching which brings the spectator closer to the future.
Finally, in a last video (Untitled), BISMUTH's strategy of short-circuiting cultural products and Cory ARCANGEL's interest in low-end technology come together. The two wryly sabotage Guy DEBORD's now classic indictment of late capitalism, the film La société du spectacle, by simulating a constant weakness of the video projector, the instruction 'Change Bulb' appearing over the images througout the film.

When He Comes
2003
64.96 x 15.35 x 15.35 inches
Pièce unique
Veritable memento mori , "When He Comes" gives the impression of a pedestal to life: a horn, placed on a table, supports a ball, inside of which the image of a blossoming flower is projected.

The Old Account
2003
85.43 x 17.72 x 17.32 inches
Pièce unique
A scene from the film “Gone with the Wind” is projected on the clock dial of ‘Grandfather Clock' from the interior. We can see Big Ben from the window of the room where this scene is taking place. A very mild sound produced by the weak voice of a little girl, repeating “Daddy, daddy” like in a nightmare, and the unceasing tick-tock sound of the clock emphasizes the ambiguity and the oppressive character of the scene.
The comforting image of the family clock contrasts with the ambivalency of the situation.

2003
70.87 x 66.14 x 10.24 inches
Pièce unique
In 'I Like to Get My Loving When I got It on My Mind', the image of a peacock is projected on a dividing screen. From the formal similarity of use of the screen and the peacock's tail, a conceptual link is added in the game of undressing and revealing, hiding in order to be more suggestive, suggesting and showing to more effectively seduce, seducing to more effectively deceive.

Salvation Lies Within
2003
48.43 x 20.47 x 13.78 inches
Pièce unique
A meticulous masterpiece, 'Salvation Lies Within' is a paper gun cut out from the pages of an illustrated family bible. Every page has been cut in a way such that the joined scraps produce a three-dimensional gun. Referring to the cliché of the American Wild West in which people would hide their gun in an artificial bible, the sculpture also evokes a strong association to print as an object of power and religion as a source of conflict.

Rocking Chair
2003
40.55 x 25.2 x 16.93 inches
Pièce unique
In this work, poetry is coupled with humour. Placed on a point of extreme balance, at the same time perfect and precarious, it seems to defy the laws of gravity - like a three-dimensional snapshot of the precise moment before the fall.
James Hopkins
Big Red
2003
35.43 x 7.87 x 1.57 inches
Pièce unique
'Big Red' is an axe whose handle has been whittled into the shape of flower just starting to bloom from its stem, a poetic representation of the opposition between nature and a manufactured object. Nature reclaims its rights while the manufactured object returns to its material origins.
James Hopkins
Paradox Passage
2002
77.95 x 31.5 x 14.96 inches
Pièce unique
The door 'Paradox Passage' has an opening made of two vertical sections standing at right angles to the wall; these sections are attached on either side of two perpendicular mirrors. The door appears to be open or closed depending on one's viewpoint, introducing an alternative dimension to the space.

Spun Out Simpsons (Detail view)

Acrylic, plastic

Pièce unique
The Simpsons is an anamorphic composition of pieces of curved coloured plastic forming a family portrait with the characters of the eponymous cult cartoon. This distorted representation is only legible from a determined viewpoint, seen from anywhere else the sculpture is nothing but an abstract and incoherent accumulation. With humour, James HOPKINS joins the classic tradition of anamorphosis with a production of popular contemporary culture - the cartoon. Both, anamorphosis and cartoons seem to escape the laws of logic and make a remark about the flexibility of reality.

Desniansky Raion
Opening on Friday, January 19, 2007, 7 - 9 pm + music performance by The Landsc Apes (aka Cyprien GAILLARD & KOUDLAM) at 8 pm

'One must ruin a palace to make it an object of interest.' (Denis DIDEROT, 1767)
Between vandalism and minimal aesthetic, romanticim and Land Art, Cyprien GAILLARD's works question man's traces in nature. The video Desniansky Raion (2007, 30'), presented for his first show at Cosmic Galerie, constantly alternates between order and chaos. Made of three parts, the video is introduced by a static shot of a building from the 70's, monumental triumphal arch at the entrance of the city of Belgrade.
The first section of the video shows a pitched battle between two hooligan gangs on the parking lot of a housing project in the suburbs of Saint Petersburg, filmed from a neighbouring building. Blues against reds, some wearing white gloves, the two compact groups move forward in an oragnised manner, then dismantle under shock before regrouping for a new assault. Calling to mind a battle scene in a medieval fresco or a classical painting, the outburst of violence, both savage and codified, is as repulsive as fascintaing.
The second part is a static shot of the façade of a high-rise block in the suburbs of Paris, on wich a show is projected mixing light, music and fireworks. This grandiose staging, usually saved for historical buildings, ends abruptly with the building collapsing. The hypnotic vision of this monolithic fortress, sublimated by light and fire before being reduced to dust, echoes like the first class funeral of the modernist architectural utopias.
The last section wanders through Desniansky Raion, a district in the suburbs of Kiev, filmed without flight clearance from a microlight, dangerously shaken by the wind, producing images both cinematographic and amateurish. Rising into a snowy and melancholic landscape, the multitude of stark buildings is at first disorderly; in this chaos of concrete then appears a group of towers arranged in a perfect circle, recalling the megalithic monument of Stonehenge, England.
Shot illegally or recovered through parallel channels, the three parts of the video demonstrate a very open minded relation to images and their status. Between classic references and contemporary tones, the soundtrack by musician KOUDLAM is a key part of the work and adds to its romantic side.
In the second room, Cyprien GAILLARD shows works from two previous series, both iconoclastic and pointing towards some of his sources of inspiration. In each of the five prints of series Belief in the Age of Desbelief, a distinct tower-block form is transferred into a Dutch landscape etching from the XVIIth century, hence transforming the naturalist visions of Rembrandt, Anthonie Waterloo and Jan Hackaert in as many building lands.
Finally, a photograph from the series Real Remnants of Fictive Wars (Part 6) , unveils Robert SMITHSON's iconic Spiral Jetty covered by a cloud of smoke. To carry out the short-lived Land Art works of this series, documented by 35mm films and photos, Cyprien GAILLARD and his accomplices activate in carefully chosen landscapes industrial fire extinguishers, releasing a thick white powder and creating a vaporous cloud as well as a veiled threat. He hence places the audience in an in-between situation, first seduced by the image of the art work before understanding the process of its creation – an act of vandalism that can be legitimized only in the art world. Through this Cyprien GAILLARD takes to his account the notion of entropy as defined by SMITHSON: a movement of transformation irreversibly aiming towards chaos.
Cyprien GAILLARD was born in 1980 in Paris (France). He lives and works in Paris. He will have a solo show at the Atelier du Jeu de Paume, Paris, next February.

The exhibition Space Oddity presents eight works which share a singular relationship to the space they occupy. The title is drawn from David Bowie's famous single of 1969 - itself recalling the film 2001: Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1968 -, which recounts the adventures of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut lost in space. The exhibition assembles works with volume, both sculptures strictly speaking and wall works, that impose their strangeness in space - in this case, the gallery's space. Representative of a certain tendency in sculpture today, they flirt with representation or seemingly engage in it, only to further blur its meaning. Often made with heterogeneous materials collected from everyday life and then customized, they reference multiple registers, playfully mingling pop culture with erudition, suburbia with minimalism, passing from rock'n'roll to science fiction.
They exhibition opens with Four Foot Red Cube Inserted in the Middle of a Garden Bench, which, true to its title, presents a cube embedded in a garden bench. Piero GOLIA (born in 1974 in Naples, lives and works in Los Angeles), by an intervention radical in scale but minimalist in form, deprives an object of its initial function while endowing it with a new aesthetic interest.
Appropriating the title of a single from the American group Eels, Novocaine for the Soul is a wall sculpture by Haluk AKAKÇE (born in 1970 in Ankara, lives and works in London), which succeeds in recreating, as in the animations for which he is best known, the depth of field for a mental space.
A block of aluminium as slender as the bow of a submarine, topped by a wrought iron crest and studded with ceramic spheres, surfing on a wooden base, Goodbye Sunny Dream by Wilfrid Almendra (born in 1972 in Cholet, lives and works in Cholet and Paris) is a kind of customized rock'n'roll Viking vessel imposing its mysterious presence on the space.
Echoing the spikes covering this last work, Justicia by Marco BOGGIO SELLA (born in 1972 in Turin, lives and works in New York) is a wall panel bristling with threatening spines, covered with metallic green car paint and presented as an allegorical evocation of justice.
The work In My Dream There Were Three Different Doors by James HOPKINS (born in 1976 in Stockport, England; lives and works in London) is a large interlocking structure made of three found doors, based on an ancient Japanese puzzle dating from the 10th century. The artist divests the doors of their function by transforming them into an obstacle that appears like a nightmarish labyrinth of closed entries.
With Tandem, Jan KLIME (born in 1980 in Brno, Czech Republic; lives and works in Brno) proposes an idiosyncratic and ironic version of a bicycle for two, literally composed of the absurd graft of two bicycles.
In the logic of his sculptural deconstructions of points of view, Main courante by Sébastien Vonier (born in 1975 in Ploemeur, France; lives and works in Rennes) suggests the outlines of a phantom staircase, proposing a new conception of space in which absence, disappearance and the invisible play an essential role. Amplified by the space which surrounds it, the familiar shape of this sculpture becomes a structure to house myriad potential scenarios.
Finally, in a second room, Marc BIJL pursues his iconoclast interrogations of symbols and codes of power, whether political, religious or economic, with Symbolic 4 (Bluetooth), three huge charred Bluetooth symbols and a video showing them aflame, evoking the Ku Kluk Klan's sinister cross burnings.

Iris van DONGEN and Dionisis KAVALLIERATOS
The Curse of the Monk
Opening on May 15, 2009, 7 - 9 pm
Exhibition on view from May 15 until July 18, 2009
Wednesday to Saturday, 2 pm - 7 pm
Placed under the sign of curse called down on them by an Orthodox monk from Mount Athos following their previous show, The Curse of the Monk brings together the universes, seemingly very different and yet as complementary as their authors, of Iris van DONGEN (born in 1975 in Tilburg, Holland, lives and works in Berlin) and Dionisis KAVALLIERATOS (born in 1979 in Athens, lives and works in Berlin). On top of being a couple, the two artists, while continuing their own line of work, very different in their inspirations and forms, reveal cross influences and decompartmentalize the presentation of their works.
Iris van DONGEN became reknown for her drawings of young women, mixing pencil, pastel, watercolour and charcoal and marrying technical virtuosity with contemporary sensitivity, as inner selfportraits of the artist. For her second show at the gallery, she presents eight new drawings and, a new practice for her, two ceramic sculptures. Some of the drawings perpetuate the dreamlike representations of her beginnings, here leaning towards Symbolism and mysticism. The other drawings, in which personal stories and feelings come to the surface, let appear a melancholic feeling in the middle of everyday life details. One sculpture (Victoria) takes after the character of one of the drawings, bearing an inordinately long nose, while the other (Bibelot) plays with its decorative aspect while reusing an element from Dionisis KAVALLIERATOS' work.
The work of KAVALLIERATOS expresses a singular, unrestrained inner world, freely mixing popular– be it Greek or 'pop' – and high culture – be it mythology, history, policy, literature or religion. Showing here a set of drawings and ceramic sculptures, he lets out a vital force seemingly unaware of conventions and the concepts of good or bad taste. Proceeding by associations of ideas, visual collages and puns far from being innocent, multiplying references within and between his works, KAVALLIERATOS creates a world of his own that reflects ours, where 'it's about being on the side of the victim but at the same time holding the wip and torturing it. About the need for heroes and the need to kill them. About the endless circle of life and stupidity, the uncertainty of death, the greateness and vanity of immortality. About revenge and betrial. About extreme hedonisme and pleasure.'
Thus, of two recurring figures, one representing Dante ALIGHIERI and the other Pellelo di Cavla, an imaginary character bearing a cap made of fruits like a symbol of the nourishing earth, and alter ego of the artist, who replaces Virgile by the side of Dante – following how Dante represented himself in The Divine Comedy. The two characters often witness extraordinary scenes, and sometimes involuntary actors of them. Witnesses when they assist, hidden behind a bed, a demonstration of omnipotence of Napoleon in front of the Virgin Mary bearing her child and Satan (Hidden in Napoleon's Boudoir); or when they watch, from the inside of a cave that could be the nose of God, the tree of innocence, of which hang reverse side condemned persons necessarily unjustly executed, as if their Rise had already started (The Tree of Innocence From Inside the Cave of Guilt and Sniffed by God). Unwilling actors when they have to face, though innocent as well, a firing squad, fortunately not very skilful (Not Even a Curly Hair William Tell's Balls).
Sharp pun with The First Expedition in the Mao-Mao Island and Mao Mao #2, at the same time recalling the Kenyan Mau Mau rebel movement of the 1950s, still refered to in Greece as a popular expression to call someone 'wild', and depicting a tribe of clones of bicephalous Mao ZEDONG; on the shore of their island land ridiculously conquering Westerners, represented by Pirrot the Mighty #2, reversing the roles by putting a pirate on the shoulder of a parrot.
From an incongruous concert of heavy metal legendary band Black Sabbath, the artist's favourite, playing in the jungle (What a Great Band) to a tale on immortality which sees an aged Marilyn seize the scythe of Death to seek revenge, whereas Death itself becomes a starlet in Marilyn's iconic windy pose (A Small Incident Between Sweet Old Marilyn and the Grim Ripper), KAVALLIERATOS revisits without complex pop culture. In Starring: Jesus as the Lamb of God, the Virgin Mary as Medea, God as the Devil, the Devil as God, Sir Winston Churchill as Himself, he casts historical and biblical characters, on a scenario inspired by the Medea's murder of her child and of the Greek paschal tradition of the spit-roasted lamb, like a sacrifice to God sacrificed, here played by Jesus.
Finally, a large drawing, The Old Bordello on the Hill of Sold Souls #4 shows the artist's ideal mausoleum, or at least a dreamt place in the after life. A sort of mastaba, its facade is decorated with sculptures of faces, some of mythical or imaginary characters, some from the artist's personal pantheon – from the members of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath to his companion Iris van DONGEN.

Iris van DONGEN & Kimberly CLARK
Doomed with Grace and Pleasure
Opening on Wednesday September 13, 2006, 6 to 9 pm
Exhibition on view from September 14 until October 28, 2006
Wednesday to Saturday, 2 to 7 pm
Dutch artist Iris van DONGEN became reknown in the last few years for her portraits of young women, between classicism and contemporary sensitivity. Usually of a large size, mixing pencil, pastel, watercolour and charcoal, each drawing pictures an isolated female character, often facing the viewer, still, almost statuary. Combining references to classical painting with contemporary elements, like objects associated with masculinity, these female characters, at the same time untouchable and vulnerable, dark and romantic, are as many different inside portraits of the artist, often borrowing her features.
While keeping on with her personal activity, Iris van DONGEN is now also part of Kimberly CLARK, a group she created with two other Dutch artists, Josepha de JONG and Ellemieke SCHOENMAKER. Iris van DONGEN's first exhibition in France is also the first official collaboration of this artist group with a subliminal name. Four new drawings by Iris van DONGEN are part of a larger set of works (sculptures, wall paintings and photographs) by Kimberly CLARK, creating a wide and coherent installation.
Wandering in the world of Kimberly CLARK, one goes from the day before the party to the party time, then to the aftermath of the party: from a messy hairdresser, both trash and glamorous, where Medusa's face reflects with a petrifying look between mythology and fairy tale, to a giant turntable spinning on the wall; from a red skeleton coming out of loudspeakers to a bench under which lays a pile of empty cigarette packs and lipsticks.
Three dummies, bearing the artists' clothes, stand as their idealised doubles, as well as an urban and sexy version of the three wise monkeys ('not seeing anything bad, not hearing anything bad, not saying anything bad' as a guideline for behaviour) with the typical gesture of taggers seeking anonymity. The installation is completed with an imposing mural, mixing several pictures from the room in the back. There, under black light, a set of photos, paintings and writings on the walls recall the cathartic night wanderings of the three members of Kimberly CLARK, under the motto 'Carpe nox', equivalent of famous 'Carpe diem' for Gothics.
Between exacerbated femininity and dark mood, release and frustration, and attraction for that very same frustration, the whole installation reflects the three artists' questioning about their identity and image as women at a key point in their lives.
Iris van DONGEN was born in Tilburg (Netherlands) in 1975, Josepha de JONG in Oosterwalde (Netherlands) in 1977, and Ellemieke SCHOENMAKER in Balkburg (Netherlands) in 1969. They live and work in Rotterdam.
Bugada & Cargnel :: Exhibitions :: Mat COLLISHAW :: Press release
Mat COLLISHAW
Exhibition on view from October 26 until December 14, 2002
Wednesday to Saturday, 2 pm to 7 pm
Renowned for his photographs and video installations, Mat COLLISHAW elaborates works that refer to society's fascination with sex, violence and certain forms of depravity. The artist uses devices creating feelings of both enchantment and disenchantment in the viewer, often by incorporating images from the media in his work that confront the spectator with the reality of his surrounding.
In his first solo exhibition in France, Mat COLLISHAW will present new works using a range of different media such as photography, painting, video, installation and mosaic. Ancient techniques mix with new technologies, while historical references meet with contemporary concerns.
Face to Kristallnacht, the attention of the visitor is immediately caught by the spellbinding sparkles coming from the black and white pictures. Senses are captured by a kaleidoscopic effect given by the light situated behind the pictures passing through multicoloured polarised lenses. But at a closer look at the images, the viewer realizes that he is confronted with the horror of the infamous "Night of Broken Glass" of November 9, 1938 when the Nazis unleashed a wave of progroms against the German Jewish community.
In Untitled (Spinning Wheel), the image which appears through the spokes of an old spinning wheel is not the one of the Sleeping Beauty of our childhood, but the one of a young woman injecting herself with heroin. The Stoned Immaculate and Ultraviolet Baby video-projections, play in a similar way with the immediate perception of the viewer and with his stereotypes, revealing the heavy weight of reality behind seducing images .
The same mecanism occurs with the mosaics which will be presented during the exhibition. Silver tears are rolling over the bewitching face of a young girl, decomposed in thirty thousand hand-painted tessels finally appear as the only clues of the resistance of reality to forms of idealisation invoked here trough one of the oldest traditional techniques.
